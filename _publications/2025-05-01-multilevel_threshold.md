This paper develops a continuous‑gain finite‑time prescribed performance control (PPC) scheme for connected vehicle platoons featuring multiple performance thresholds. By integrating a novel multilevel threshold function with a finite‑time performance bound, the proposed PPC law enforces that each vehicle’s tracking error enters its user‑defined performance region within a guaranteed time. A new finite‑time sliding‑mode reaching law is then introduced, upon which an enhanced sliding‑mode platoon controller is built. The overall strategy simultaneously ensures (1) finite‑time individual‑vehicle stability, (2) finite‑time string stability, and (3) asymptotic convergence of the inter‑vehicle spacing error. Comprehensive numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach under various platoon‑formation scenarios.
