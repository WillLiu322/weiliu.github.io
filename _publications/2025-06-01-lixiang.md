This paper addresses the secure control of vehicular platoon systems (VPCS) subject to joint sensor and actuator attacks as well as unknown disturbances. An adaptive sensor fusion algorithm is first proposed to estimate the true vehicle position with minimal error. Based on the fused position, a predefined-time extended state observer (PTESO) is designed to accurately reconstruct the continuous-time velocity, acceleration, and disturbances within a user-defined time. Leveraging these estimates, a variable exponent predefined-time sliding mode controller (VPTSMC) is developed to ensure predefined-time string stability and individual vehicle stability, while avoiding control singularities. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed secure control strategy.
