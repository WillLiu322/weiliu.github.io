This paper addresses finite‑time prescribed performance control for uncertain 2‑D planar vehicular platoon systems subject to external disturbances. A novel class of finite‑time performance functions (FnTPFs) is first designed to ensure both spacing and bearing tracking errors converge into their predefined bounds within a user‑specified time, with strictly limited overshoot. Next, third‑order finite‑time sliding‑mode surfaces are developed, leading to an enhanced sliding‑mode control law that drives the platoon errors arbitrarily close to zero in finite time while mitigating chattering and singularity issues. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the proposed method’s fast convergence, small overshoot characteristics, and clear advantages over existing PPC approaches.
