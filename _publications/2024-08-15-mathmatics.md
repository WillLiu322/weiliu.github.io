This paper investigates the fault-tolerant control problem for vehicular platoons experiencing time-varying actuator fault directions and distance constraints. A bias constraint function is introduced to symmetrize the asymmetric spacing constraints, and a unified barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) method is employed to ensure safety in inter-vehicle distances. On this basis, an adaptive fixed-time fault-tolerant controller is proposed within a sliding mode control framework, enhanced by a novel Nussbaum function to handle unknown and time-varying actuator fault directions. Theoretical analysis confirms that both individual vehicle stability and platoon string stability are achieved in fixed time. The proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical simulations.
