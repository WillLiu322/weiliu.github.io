This paper addresses fixed-time prescribed performance control in vehicular platoons subject to input nonlinearities such as actuator dead-zone and saturation. The proposed method introduces a flexible, self-adjusting performance boundary that ensures the tracking error remains within a predefined region even when actuator nonlinearities occur. A new adaptive fixed-time sliding mode control approach, including a compensator for faster convergence, is developed to address these challenges. The analysis shows that the approach guarantees fixed-time individual vehicle stability, fixed-time string stability, and fixed-time prescribed performance. Simulations and experiments confirm the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method under realistic conditions.
