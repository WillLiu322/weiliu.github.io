This paper develops a continuous‑gain finite‑time prescribed performance control (PPC) framework tailored for connected vehicle platoons with multiple performance thresholds. By integrating a multilevel threshold function with a finite‑time performance bound, the proposed PPC law drives each vehicle’s tracking error into its user‑defined performance region within a specified time. A novel finite‑time reaching law is then derived, leading to an improved sliding‑mode platoon control algorithm. The combined strategy guarantees (1) finite‑time individual‑vehicle stability, (2) finite‑time string stability, and (3) asymptotic convergence of the inter‑vehicle spacing error. Numerical simulations confirm the method’s feasibility and robust performance under various platooning scenarios.
